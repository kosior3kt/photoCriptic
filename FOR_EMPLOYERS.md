This project has been done as a university assignment, where I've been forced to use this weird OOP-ish structure. Normally it would look much cleaner.
Thank you for your attention


Also
This program is designed to encode a message in photo based on brightness levels of pixels in it. Because of pretty heavy math involved it changes on more than 1 in 63  
 pixels by on more than 1/255 (brightness) on 1 out of 4 colour chanels. It also doesn't require you to have original photo to decode encoded one.
 For more math-heavy explanation wait until i upload yt explanation how it works (guess I'll do it later)
